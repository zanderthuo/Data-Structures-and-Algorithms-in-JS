## Time complexity
O(1) - does not change with respect to input space. Hence, O(1) is referred to as being
constant time

O(n) - ) is linear time and applies to algorithms that must do n operations in the
worst-case scenario.

Logarithm O(logn) - An Inverse of exponentiation. 
            log2(8)=3 --------> 2^3=8
            log2(value) --------> 2^exponent = value
            - The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you
            can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than
            or equal to one.
            - Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.
            - Efficient algorithms involve logarithms
            - Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
